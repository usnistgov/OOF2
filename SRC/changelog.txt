OOF2 2.1.19

* Selection sizes are reported as percentages as well as absolute
  numbers.

* Skeleton modification routines report the total number of nodes and
  elements after the modification, not just the change.

OOF2 2.1.18

* Added OOF.PixelGroup.AutoGroup, which puts every pixel into a group
  according to either its color or orientation, even in the presence
  of noise.

* Almost all material properties can now be included in output files
  and viewed in the Mesh Data Viewer window, using a new Material
  Constants branch of the Aggregate Outputs tree.

* More than one type of output can be printed on one line of an output
  file, by using the Concatenate output.

OOF2 2.1.17

* Significant speed up of the element/pixel intersection code.

* Fixed a bug in the Skeleton Rationalize method that could create bad
  boundaries in periodic Skeletons.

* Fixed a bug in the Quaternion class in some limiting cases.

* Added tools in the Pixel Selection page and Pixel Selection toolbox
  for selecting pixels with a range of orientations, if the
  Microstructure has an orientation map.  A "range of orientations" is
  defined by a lattice symmetry and a maximum misorientation. 

* Added OrientationBurn, which selects sets of contiguous pixels if
  their orientation mismatch is smaller than a given threshold.

OOF2 2.1.16

* New robust calculation of element/pixel intersection areas.

OOF2 2.1.15  (Packaged but not actually released?)

* Fixed a problem with displaying images in some situations, due to
  changes in the ImageMagick library.

* Fixed a bug in the widgets for choosing Skeleton groups when used as
  command arguments.

OOF2 2.1.14

* Fixed a bug that could cause spurious error messages when solving
  time-dependent problems involving both thermal diffusion and
  elasticity.

* Fixed bugs that were raising spurious error messages in Relax.

* Fixed a bug in Fix Illegal Elements.

* Fixed a bug that caused crashes during illegal Skeleton node moves
  in debug mode.

* Fixed Copy_All_Solvers.

* Fixed a bug that was causing OOF2 to fail to load when built with
  gcc 7.

OOF2 2.1.13

* Changed the sign of the force balance equation so that the stiffness
  matrix is positive definite, so that it can be used with canned
  solvers that expect it to be that way.  This has the unfortunate
  effect of changing the sign of Neumann boundary conditions (applied
  stresses) for elasticity problems and also changing the sign of all
  the stress outputs.

* Hacked the Flux classes so that the sign changes in the force
  balance equation are invisible to the user.  Neumann BCs and stress
  outputs have the same signs they always have had.

* Removed a stray debugging line that was printing "No intersections
  on this element..."

* Fixed a bug that was sometimes causing SnapRefine to create illegal
  elements and also sometimes computing segment homogeneities
  incorrectly.

OOF2 2.1.12

* Changed setup.py to allow C++11.

* Fixed setup.py so that it understands sys.platform==linux3.

* Changed setup.py to link with tcmalloc if it's available.

* Fixed a bug in the Range output.

* A modified version of swig is now included in the OOF2 distribution,
  and the setup.py script now builds and uses it.  The --skip-swig
  option is no longer required (or allowed).

* Fixed a bug in the Point class hash function that made saving large
  meshes in abaqus format very slow.  Other operations may have been
  affected as well.

* Fixed a bug in the handling of invalid inputs to
  LogDefiniteProgress::setFraction().  This may have never occurred.

* Fixed a bug in pixel group comparison that was effectively making
  all unmeshable groups meshable.

* Fixed a bug in annealing and smoothing periodic skeletons.

OOF2 2.1.11

* Fixed a bug introduced in 2.1.10 by being too aggressive about
  cleaning up unused code that wasn't actually unused.

OOF2 2.1.10

* Fixed a possible divide-by-zero error that could arise from an
  unlikely and perverse choice of end points for a cross section.

* Modifications for compatibility with the clang++ compiler on OS X
  10.9.

* Fixed a theoretical but unobserved bug that could occur when two
  Skeleton edge boundaries wrapped around a single element in both
  directions. 

OOF2 2.1.9

* The Save button on the Microstructure page now allows the file
  format to be selected.

* Fixed a bug in abaqus output of skeletons with materials.

OOF2 2.1.8

* Reduced the memory footprint of dense-matrix multiplications.

* Added a "Pause" command to the GUI Logging menu.

* Fixed a bug in copying Neumann boundary conditions.

* Hacked the build scripts to accomodate the Gentoo "prefix" package
  manager's hacked version of distutils.

* Fixed the pole figure test in the TEST directory.  Twice.

OOF2 2.1.7

* Added a build time check for GraphicsMagick, which is meant to be
  compatible with ImageMagick, but isn't.

* Worked around a problem in which the setup script couldn't find
  pygtk on systems using MacPorts with Python 2.6 or later.

* Fixed bugs and misconceptions in the generation of pole figures.

OOF2 2.1.6

* Fixed leaky memory in image modification.

* Fixed a bug in reporting malformed materials.

* Changes required for the clang compiler in OS X 10.7.

* Added a "Generic" orientation map reader that ought to be able to
  read most EBSD files if they contain ascii lines with xy and
  orientation data in them.  It can flip the input data in the x and y
  directions and apply a constant offset to the orientations.

* Added the option to flip data and offset the orientations to the TSL
  and TSL2 orientation map readers.

* Added a Pole Figure generation command to the Orientation Map menu.

* Fixed bug in setting default display parameters for pixel
  selections.

* Fixed the skeleton boundary display, which was using the arrow width
  instead of the line width for all but the first segment of the
  displayed edge boundaries.

OOF2 2.1.5

* Fixed the ascii output for rank 2 tensors so that it doesn't lose
  precision for very small values.

* Fixed a Tetragonal elasticity bug.  The modulus was being saved
  incorrectly in binary data files.

OOF2 2.1.4

* Fixed another bug that caused crashes when using orientation maps
  with particular Mesh geometries.  Round-off error was causing the
  OrientationMapProperty to try to evaluate an orientation at a pixel
  outside of the map.

* Fixed a crash triggered by using the 9-noded quadrilateral element.
  You shouldn't use this element anyway, since the 8-noded quad is
  cheaper and equally accurate.

* Changed the default values of the Hexagonal and Tetragonal elastic
  moduli so that they're not singular.  The default values are now
  effectively isotropic.

* Fixed a bug that could cause the program to hang when computing
  contour plots.

* Fixed some memory leaks in contour plots.

OOF2 2.1.3

* Fixed a bug that caused crashes when using orientation maps,
  plotting stresses, and rebuilding meshes.

OOF2 2.1.2

* The interpretation of the heat source property has been changed, to
  make it sane.  A positive heat source adds heat to the system. 

* Fixed bugs related to time dependent boundary conditions in
  quasistatic problems.

* Added a mechanism for setting the initial values for floating
  boundary conditions in time dependent problems.

OOF2 2.1.1

* Scheduled Output data files are no longer automatically rewound,
  ever.  If repeating a calculation, the files need to be rewound
  manually if the results of the first calculation should be
  overwritten. 

* Typing in the time entry box in a graphics window is friendlier.  It
  was moving the cursor to the left after every keystroke.

* New images created from orientation maps are now displayed in the
  graphics window if there are no other images present.

* Added a new orientation map reader, "TSL2", which can read some more
  modern TSL .ang files.  There is no good way to determine which
  reader to use.

* TSL orientation map data can contain negative xy coordinates.
  Points no longer need to be provided in a particular order.

* The "Existing Stream" option for specifying an destination for output
  is no longer available.  Use "Output Stream" instead.  Multiple
  Output Streams can point to the same file.  If they have different
  modes, the most recently selected mode will be used.

* Fixed crashing bugs in abaqus output for skeletons and in creating
  skeleton element, node, and segment groups from pixel groups.

* Changed the Schedule_Solution and Scrub_Solution commands in the
  OOF.Subproblem menu to Enable_Solution and Disable_Solution.

* Moved Copy_All_Solvers from the Subproblem menu to the Mesh menu.

* Fixed a setup problem with Python 2.7.

* Fixed scheduled outputs so that multiple outputs sent to a single
  file are always written in the same order.

OOF2 2.1.0

* Time dependence!

* On OS X, OOF2 now links to the Accelerate framework instead of the
  deprecated vecLib framework.

* Fixed a long standing bug that caused an error when invoking a
  togglable menu (eg, ActivityViewer/Settings/AutoDismiss) item in a
  re-opened window.

* The Mesh Info toolbox will now give info for empty elements
  (elements with no material) if "Hide Empty Mesh Elements" is
  unchecked in the gfx window's Settings menu.

* If a Mesh is created from a Skeleton, and then that Skeleton is
  changed, the Mesh will be "out of sync" until it has been explicitly
  rebuilt using the "Rebuild" Mesh modifier on the Mesh Page.  An out
  of sync Mesh cannot be solved, saved, or otherwise operated on in
  any way.  This restriction "fixes" some bugs in earlier versions.
  For similar reasons, Adaptive mesh refinement is now only available
  as a Skeleton refinement target, and not as a Mesh modification
  method.

* Materials can now be assigned to Skeleton element groups and segment
  groups.  They can no longer be assigned directly to Mesh elements.
  This change may break old scripts.

* Eigenvalues of tensor Fluxes can be computed as Outputs.

* Pixel groups are listed in alphabetical order instead of
  chronological order.

* Automatic creation of pixel groups is much faster, and
  automatically generated group names are shorter.  This change may
  break old scripts.

* Errors are handled better when loading scripts.

* Progress bars in text mode just report percentages, and don't try to
  draw a bar with ascii art.  Single tasks can have more than one
  progress bar.

* The 'all' placeholder argument for things like pixel selections has
  been changed to 'every'.  Scripts that contain command arguments
  like 'pixels=all' should still work.

* The ContinuumProfile parameter for boundary condition profiles has
  been split into three.  Dirichlet conditions use
  ContinuumProfileXTd, Floating conditions use ContinuumProfileX, and
  Force uses ContinuumProfileXT.  Scripts have to be updated.

* The regression and gui tests now use temp directories, allowing
  multiple tests to be run simultaneously on the same file system.


OOF2 2.0.5a10:

* Fixed a bug in the geometric strain output calculations.  The xz and
  yz components were a factor of 2 too large.  Fixed a partially
  compensating bug in plane-stress elasticity.

* Fixed a bug on the Boundary Analysis page.  The destination window's
  value wasn't being used, so output only went to the Message Window.


OOF2 2.0.5a7, 2.0.5a8 or 2.0.5a9:

* The directory containing the log file left behind when OOF2 quits
  unexpectedly can now be set by setting the OOFTMP environment
  variable.  If the variable is unset, the log file will appear
  whereever it did before this change (determined by the behavior of
  python's tempfile.mkstemp function).

* The abaqus file for meshes no longer contains split nodes at
  interfaces.

* Changed setup.py so that oofconfig.h is installed in
  include/OOFNAME/, where OOFNAME is either 'oof2' or 'oof3d'.  This
  will enable users (and developers) to have both versions installed.

* Fixed the image save functionality in displaying orientation map
  images.

* Property API now includes begin_point and end_point hooks, called at
  the start and end of operations at a particular evaluation
  point. Properties with expensive point-specific operations can
  perform them and cache the result with this hook.

OOF2 2.0.5a6:

* Fixed an AutoSkeleton bug.  It was specifying min_distance for
  SnapRefine in the wrong units.

* Modified (and hopefully improved) the SnapNodes algorithm.

* New file selector widgetry.  Dialog boxes that ask for file names
  now look and behave just like other dialog boxes.

* Quitting, saying you want to save the log file, and then cancelling
  now cancels both the Quit and the Save.  It used to cancel the Save,
  but would still Quit.

OOF2 2.0.5a5:

* Fixed more memory leaks.

OOF2 2.0.5a4

* Optimization: Homogeneity energy isn't computed if alpha==0.

* Fixed many memory leaks.

* Constructing edge boundaries from node groups now works.

* Added '--nanoHUB' as a build option.  If it's present, using the
  console and loading scripts are disabled for security.

* Optimization: Homogeneity energy isn't computed if alpha==0.

* The min_distance parameter for Snap Refine now has a minimum allowed
  value which is 1/100 of the pixel size.  This prevent Snap Refine
  from creating illegal elements.

* Rationalize can now remove high aspect ratio quads.

* Fixed bugs in the Skeleton Info toolbox that made it impossible to
  select illegal elements by double clicking in the list of a
  Segment's or Node's elements.

OOF2 2.0.5a3

* Fixed the HeatSource property -- it had no integration_order method.

OOF2 2.0.5a2

* Fixed a possible divide-by-zero in Skeleton rationalization.

* Modified the AutoSkeleton script so that it uses a non-zero
  min_distance in SnapRefine.

* Fixed a problem with loading data files for meshes with initialized
  out-of-plane fields.

* Fixed a round-off error problem that could cause crashes when the
  physical pixel size wasn't 1x1.

* Removed some of the adaptive mesh refinement tests from the test
  suite.  The algorithm appears to be unstable, and gives different
  answers on different machines.  This doesn't necessarily mean that
  it's useless, but it makes it hard to test.

OOF2 2.0.5a1

* Fixed bugs that were preventing MaterialImages from being drawn in
  pdf output files.

* New 'Interfaces' Task Page. Whenever an interface is created or deleted,
  the mesh is rebuilt.

* Materials have either a 'bulk' or 'interface' attribute.

* Interface materials can be assigned to interfaces and skeleton boundaries.
  (via buttons on the Materials page).

* Properties can be compatible with (or assignable to) a bulk material, or 
  an interface material, or to both.

* Added an Edgement display.

* When a field gets defined on a subproblem, the field values can get set
  by an initializer only if that field is not defined on any other subproblem.

* Fixed the following: An error message shows up after performing the following
  sequence of operations:
  (1) Create a skeleton and refine it a few times.
  (2) Create a mesh.
  (3) Click Undo on the Skeleton page.
  (4) Go to the Skeleton page and perform a Modify operation on any of the
      edge boundaries.

* Added a subproblem parameter to the Adaptive Mesh Refinement operation.

* Re-enabled Perimeter display.

* Added a right-click popup menu to the graphics window layer list.

OOF2 2.0.4

* Fixed a bug in scriptloader.py for python versions >= 2.4.  It
  wasn't correctly parsing code blocks in which the first left
  parenthesis ended a line, because of changes in the python compiler
  module in version 2.4.  The new version works for 2.3, 2.4, and
  2.5. 

* Fixed a bug that could cause a division by zero error if the
  physical dimensions of a Microstructure are integers.

* In versions 2.0.2 and 2.0.3, OOF lets you use the CG solver even for
  non-symmetric problems. 

OOF2 2.0.4b2

* Fixed a crash on quitting on NetBSD systems (and possibly others).

OOF2 2.0.4 (beta 1 and earlier)
* Element, Node, and Segment groups can now be created automatically
  from Pixel Groups, using the "Auto" button on the Skeleton Selection
  page.  If a pixel group subsequently changes, the Skeleton groups do
  *not* automatically update themselves.  New "Clear All" and "Delete
  All" buttons operate on all Skeleton groups.

* Added a "name_template" argument to OOF.Image.AutoGroup, so that
  the format of group names can be set by the user.

* Added a "Deviator" invariant for symmetric 3x3 tensors, which 
  measures the amount of shear represented by a tensor.

* Fixed some bugs in the Rationalize Skeleton modifier that could create
  inconsistent periodic Skeletons.

* When a node gets pinned (unpinned), its periodic partner(s) also get
  pinned (unpinned).

* Updated "Copy All..." in the boundary conditions page to be able to copy
  periodic boundary conditions.

* Added Active Area display parameters and initial graphics window size to the
  OOF.Settings.Graphics_Defaults menu.

* Added a --with-swig argument to setup.py's build command, for
  specifying the name of a non-standard swig program.

* API CHANGE: Property::precompute() takes an FEMesh* argument.  The
  Property class has new functions set_mesh_data and get_mesh_data
  that can be used to store and retrieve mesh-specific property data.
  The optional function clear_mesh_data() is called when it's time for
  the Property to delete its mesh-specific data.

* API CHANGE: The Orientation Property now uses an abstract
  COrientation class, that's not restricted to being an Euler angle.
  Tensor transform() methods take a COrientation* instead of a
  MATRIX_D.

* Added the ability to read orientation map data files, and an
  OrientationMap material property that uses the orientation map data
  instead of an explicit Orientation.  Only one orientation map file
  may be associated with any one Microstructure.

* Added a Microstructure display method for showing the Orientation of
  pixels, whether from an Orientation or an OrientationMap Property.
  Also added a method for displaying a Microstructure's orientation
  map, whether or not it's being used in a Property.

* In labelled sliders in the GUI (slider widgets with a text entry
  box), the relative size of the slider and the text can be adjusted.
  When more than one such slider is in the same GUI box, they all
  adjust together.
  

OOF2 2.0.3

* Fixed a bug that reported a spurious material property collision
  error when a property with a symmetric tensor parameter was reloaded
  from a data file or script.

* Periodic boundary conditions.

* Added an OOF.Settings.Graphics_Defaults menu which lets default
  display parameters (such as skeleton edge color and linewidth) be
  set *before* a graphics window is opened.  These commands can be put
  in the .oof2rc file.

* Fixed a bug that would crash the program if the Activity Viewer
  window was closed while progress bars were still active.  Thanks to
  Yu Dong for the bug report.

* Colons are now prohibited in the names of Microstructures, Images,
  Skeletons, Meshes, SubProblems, and Properties.  They caused
  problems before.

* Python 2.5 compatibility.

* Enhanced SnapRefine to use up to two transition points along an edge.

* Auto Skeleton button for one-click creating and refining of Skeletons. 

* Fixed a bug that made Skeleton modifications fail if the
  Skeleton or its Microstructure had been renamed.

* Fixed a bug in the Mesh Info toolbox in which triangular mesh
  elements don't get selected when a user mouse-clicks on such elements.

OOF2 2.0.2

* Subproblems.

* Fixed a bug that could crash the program if a Material was redefined
  in a data file, and that data file was loaded after a Mesh was
  created from a Microstructure that used the old definition of the
  Material.

* Fixed an initialization bug for the cross-section widget on the 
  analysis page.  It was initialized incorrectly if there were 
  already cross-sections in the mesh.

* Fixed the energy computation in the stress-free strain.
 
* Fixed the conversion routines for the Goldstein XYZ rotation 
  convention.

* Fixed a synchronization bug in the Materials page -- properties
  added via console/menu operations weren't synchronizing the 
  Materials page correctly.

* Added right-hand-side contribution code to the PlaneFluxEquation,
  so that plane-stress stress-free-strains are computed correctly.
  
* The Mesh Info toolbox now lists the Fields that are defined on
  Nodes.

* Fixed a bug in the menus for the Analysis page, which could cause
  nonsense output to be generated because Material precomputation
  wasn't being done.

* Added OOF.PixelSelection.Select_Material, which selects all pixels
  with a given Material assigned to them.  The specified Material may be
  "<Any>", "<None>", or any defined Material.

* Progress bars are no longer drawn when using the --batch flag.

* The "File/Save/Python Log" dialog box's OK button is now sensitized
  more or less correctly.  It used to be insensitive if
  "File/Load/Script" had been used and the directory hadn't been
  changed.  It's still not properly desensitized when the new file
  name is blank, but that's less bad than having it always be
  insensitive.

* Fixed a bug that was causing RWLock errors when changing Skeleton
  modifiers.

* Changes to the API for extensions are documented in Appendix B in
  the manual.

* Fixed a bug in the layer editor that caused the gui tests to
  fail intermittently, and may have caused the wrong layers to be sent
  to the graphics windows in real life, occasionally.

OOF2 2.0.1

* "setup.py install" now copies the examples/extension directory.

* It should no longer be necessary to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to run
  oof2 on Macs.

* Sensitized the Load button on the Image page correctly.  It was only
  sensitive if there was another Image already in the current
  Microstructure.

* Added a "Save Text" item to the Tutorial window's File menu.  It
  saves the current tutorial to a file.

OOF2 2.0.0

* Added a GUI test suite.

* Revised the Boundary Analysis page.  There is now a pull-down menu
  for selecting the operation, and the boundaries appear in a separate
  list.  The available operations are "Integrate Flux" (which was
  there before) and "Average Field" (which is new).  Scripts that used
  the old Integrate Flux will need to be updated.

* Fixed a bug that was causing incorrect output for quantities that
  depended on properly initialized properties.  In particular, the
  elastic energy density for anisotropic materials was computed
  incorrectly. 

* Fixed the tetragonal Cijkl widget.  It was displaying the wrong
  value for c26.  The correct value was being used internally when the
  full Cijkl was constructed.  Similarly, the C4i widget was
  displaying the wrong value for d32.

* Fixed a bug in the orthorhombic Cijkl widget.  It was discarding c66
  and using c55 instead.

* Fixed a bug in which skeleton nodes dragged outside the bounds of
  the microstructure couldn't be dragged back inside.

* Rewrote the script loader code so that it works.  The old version
  couldn't handle "else", "elif", or "except" blocks.  The new version
  can still be confused, but you'd have to go out of your way to do so.

* Changed the behavior of control-D in the console window, because I
  kept closing the window by mistake when I meant to delete a
  character.

* Fixed a crashing bug when selecting pixels with the brush tool.

* Modified the pixel information toolbox so that pixel colors can be
  shown in either RGB or HSV formats.

* Fixed a bug in the constructor for the Quad skeleton geometry which 
  misplaced the topleft and topright boundaries if the skeleton is 
  not square.

* Fixed the C3v tensor widget and parameter, which were just wrong.
  Fixed the diagram for the D3 tensor in the manual.

* Added some clarifying output to the regression test suite -- 
  tests now print out their identity when they run.

* Fixed a typo that was truncating the physical dimensions of images
  to integers.  This was especially bad for images with sizes less
  than one.

OOF2 2.0.beta 8

* Improved the mesh data viewer window.  It now updates its options
  as Fields and Equations are modified, and always displays data for
  the topmost Mesh in its associated graphics window.  The position of
  the queried point can be changed by entering x and y values
  explicitly, as well as by clicking on the graphics window.

* Fixed long standing zooming bugs.  Toggling the antialiased canvas
  no longer slides the image off the screen, and focussed zooming
  (shift-click and control-click in the Viewer Toolbox) works
  properly.

* The arrows on the scroll bars for the canvas in the graphics window
  now work properly.

* Added a command for selecting all Skeleton Elements with a given
  Material, or with no Material at all.

* Added an "UndoBuffer Size" menu to the Settings menu, to choose how
  many previous versions of various objects should be kept lying
  around.

* Filled and plain contour displays respect the "Hide Empty Mesh
  Elements" setting.

* Fixed a bug in the filled-contour display that would incorrectly use
  the element-selection fill color for some elements for which all the 
  values are above the highest selected contour.

* 'True' and 'False' are allowed as variable values in ascii data
  files.

* Fixed a bug that could cause crashes or convergence failures when
  elements had no assigned material.

* Skeleton element homogeneity calculations are faster by a factor of
  two or so.  Many Skeleton modifications are faster as a result.

* Stiffness matrix calculation is faster by a factor of two or three.

* Changed the behavior of "python setup.py clean".  It no longer
  removes the swig output files unless --swig is specified.

* Fixed scriptloader.py so that it doesn't raise a SyntaxError on
  unindented lines immediately after indented blocks in scripts.

* Added "Hide Empty Mesh Elements" to the graphics window's Settings
  menu.

OOF2 2.0.b7

* Made it impossible to try to use plane flux equations to satisfy
  boundary conditions.

* Added an 'alpha' parameter to the Skeleton refinement command.  It's
  used to evaluate the effective element energies and to make the best
  choice when there's more than one way of subdividing an element.

* Changed the name of the 'selectable' parameter in the pixel
  selection toolbox commands to 'source'.  Changed 'selectable' in all
  other pixel selection commands to 'microstructure'.  (The toolbox
  commands work on both Images and Microstructures.)

* Fixed a bug in which loading a named Property from a data file
  overwrote the parameters for the corresponding unnamed Property.

* Fixed several sensitization errors in the Analyze page.

* Fixed output.getOutput so that a partial path in one OutputTree (eg,
  'Strain' in scalarOutputs) doesn't hide a full path in another (eg,
  'Strain' in aggregateOutputs).

* Commented out the constructors for the superparametric element 
  classes.  These are useless, since there's no sensible way of 
  placing intermediate mapping nodes, or of drawing the result.

* It's now impossible to try to copy or delete a deleted layer in the
  LayerEditor.  Edited layers are now selected automatically in the
  LayerEditor's list.

* Made the CG solver the default for symmetric stiffness matrices.
  Changed the order of the preconditioners so the deprecated block
  preconditioner is no longer the default.

* Fixed a memory leak in some Field output routines.

* Fixed an indexing error that caused errors in the ILU or IC 
  preconditioners for plane-stress isotropic elasticity problems. 
  The previous workaround was to use the block preconditioner, but 
  the ILU or IC preconditioners should now be usable directly.

* Changed the circumstances under which the pixel selection layer will be
  displayed automatically in a graphics window -- previously it would
  display when the layer list included any object from which a microstructure
  could be deduced.  Now, it will only show up if there is a microstructure
  or an image in the graphics window.  This gives it the same behavior
  as the pixel selection toolbox.  

* Changed the "save image" function of the graphics window "File" menu
  to generate PDFs instead of PostScript, because PDF has better support
  for transparency.

* Fixed a bug that confused the microstructure material display if a
  postscript or pdf file was saved.

* Fixed a bug when saving rank 2 and rank 3 tensors in binary data files.

* Removed the z-component of the ForceDensity Property.

* Fixed a bug in the matrix widgets used for parametrizing properties
  with symmetry-constrainted matrix parameters.  Invalid inputs in these
  widgets could throw an exception inside a GTK event callback, which 
  would crash the application. 

* Split the monolithic oofcppcmodule.so library into four separate
  shared libraries and a whole bunch of python extension modules.
  This allows oof2 to be loaded in a modular fashion (omitting the
  GUI, for example), and will allow extensions to be added without
  rebuilding the main program.  The new library configuation is only
  available in the distutils version. The "configure and make" version
  doesn't work anymore.

* Changed the PinNodes toolbox to provide a "skeleton" argument to its
  menu items, so that these will make sense in scripts.  This is an API
  change that will break older scripts which used submenu items below
  OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Pin_Nodes.

* Improved the performance of SnapNodes by at least 25%
  by keeping track of moved nodes and use them to accelerate associated
  movers -- there are other minor contributing factors.

* Fixed a problem which caused skeletons loaded from data files to 
  show incorrect homogeneity indices on the skeleton page.  Also 
  made the Skeleton Selection page's groups widget update correctly.

* Fixed a deadlock.  Showing and hiding a contour map too rapidly
  could make the program hang.

OOF2 2.0.b6

* Moved the image-save menu item from OOF.Image.Save to OOF.File.Save.Image,
  for consistency with the other who objects.  

* Changed the way the matrix symmetrization is done, making it independent
  of the order in which equations are defined.  This makes the 
  preconditioners work more reliably.

* Fixed a bug that made it impossible to copy pixel groups.

* Switched gui libraries from gtk+1.2 to gtk+2.6.

* Added a "Settings" menu to the main window, and put a "Fonts" submenu
  in it.  Fonts/Widgets command changes the font used in the GUI, and
  Fonts/Fixed changes the font used in the Message window and other
  text displays.

* Added a "Theme" command to the Settings menu, allowing Gnome gui
  skins to be used.

* If the file ".oof2rc" exists in the user's home directory, the OOF2
  menu commands in it will be processed at the start of every OOF2
  session. 

* Fixed a sign error in the flux output calculation that was causing
  incorrect results for fluxes with offset values, such as stress when
  the thermal expansion property has a non-zero T0.

* Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when switching between contour
  plots with vastly different ranges of values.

OOF2 2.0.b5.1

* Updated the tutorials to reflect the changes in b5.

OOF2 2.0.b5

* Changed the arguments to the New Mesh command.

* Reorganized and rationalized the Property hierarchy.

* Mesh elements with no assigned Material aren't drawn in the graphics
  window.  Skeleton elements still are drawn, though, even with if
  they have no Material.

* Removed the Perimeter display method for Meshes.  It wasn't
  working.  If anyone needs it, let us know.

* Fixed a sign error that was causing thermal expansion with a
  non-zero T0 to fail.

* During execution, a Python log is now stored in a temporary file,
  and is removed if the program exits properly, but is available for
  examination if the program aborts.

* Added a check to the solver to detect equations for which no
  material contributes to their flux.  
 
* Fixed a bug in the saving and reading of field initializers in
  binary data files.

* Fixed a bug in calculating the effective energy of quadrilateral
  elements.  Quads were much too susceptible to deformation.

* Fixed an iterator bug in the SparseLinkMatrix which caused the
  finite-element A matrix to be extracted incorrectly when there
  were empty rows in the master stiffness matrix.

* Fixed a bug in the element-finding code which was causing infinite
  loops in the element-selection process of the skeleton info toolbox.

* Implemented a new algorithm for computing the area-fractions of 
  the pixel categories in skeleton elements.  This algorithm tracks
  the edges of the pixel categories, and is 3-10x faster than the 
  old algorithm.

* Fixed a bug in copying skeletons, the boundary book-keeping was
  done incorrectly, causing an error if a later attempt was made to
  delete a boundary.

* Made copying the field or equation state from a mesh to itself a
  no-op.  It used to cause a deadlock.

* Fixed a bug that could raise an exception when selecting a node in
  "keyboard" mode in the Move Node toolbox.

* Changed the arguments of the SelectNode call in the MoveNode
  toolbox, so that it takes a Point instead of x and y.  Ditto for the
  Skeleton Info toolbox commands, QueryElement, QueryNode, and
  QuerySegment, and the Mesh Info toolbox commands, QueryElement and
  QueryNode.   Ditto for the Pin Nodes toolbox commands, Pin, UnPin,
  and TogglePin.

* Allowed the FluxProfileSet parameter for Neumann boundary conditions
  to be abbreviated in scripts.  It's now possible to say
  profile=[profile1,profile2] instead of
  profile=FluxProfileSet([profile1,profile2]).

* The "Meshable" button in the Microstructure page is now set properly
  when the selected group changes.

* Meshes are now automatically displayed, like Skeletons.

* Fixed a bug introduced in 2.0.b4 that prevented Materials from being
  saved.

* Cancelling the "Save Profile" dialog doesn't cause an error anymore.

* Fixed and simplified the Viewer toolbox.

* Fixed a bug that was making modified Images lose their names.

* Fixed a bug that was preventing the Repeat button in the Selection
  toolboxes from working properly, sometimes.  The "Repeat" button in
  the toolboxes now desensitizes properly if the mouse coord fields
  are incomplete or incorrect.

* Opening a Mesh Data Viewer when no Fields are defined no longer
  crashes the program.

OOF2 2.0.b4

* Added a display method that colors skeleton elements according to
  their effective energy.

* Fixed a bug in which the Rationalize skeleton modifier sometimes
  destroyed skeleton edge boundaries.

* Fixed a bug in the destruction of Skeletons when the undo buffer
  filled up.

* Fixed a bug in which the selected Skeleton boundary would disappear
  from the display when its display parameters were edited.

* Added the Coulomb equation, electric fields, and piezoelectric couplings
  for all the crystallographic point groups.

* Changed the 'skelname' parameter in all PinNodes operations to
  'skeleton'.

* Improved the 'FixIllegal' Skeleton modifier.

* Fixed menu sensitization errors.  The Layer/Edit menu item was
  sensitive even when no layer was selected.  The File/Save menu items
  were sensitive if there was nothing to save.

* Fixed a bug in the node-hashing code which prevented node selections
  from working on sparse high-aspect-ratio skeletons.

* Added a "Pin Nodes" page to accomodate pinning processes that
  don't need mouse clicks. Also, changed tutorial to reflect this.

* Made it impossible to delete predefined Properties.

* Added clean-up code to the Mesh Cross-Section widget.  This fixes
  a bug where GTK errors would arise after this widget had been 
  deselected on the analysis page.

* Put widgets for the DirectOutput parameters "comment character" and
  "separator" in the Mesh Cross-Section toolbox.

* Fixed the broken "Prev" and "Next" buttons.  They worked in 2.0.b2
  but not in 2.0.b3.

* Fixed signalling problems in the skeleton and movenode tutorials.
  The "Next" button wasn't sensitizing correctly for many tutorial pages.

* Added a skeleton modifier, called Relax, that uses the local measure 
  of inhomogeneity and shape quality to improve the mesh. The
  modifier creates a finite element mesh and minimizes an energy functional,
  analogous to the one of an elastic-plastic solid.

* Added a Newton-Raphson solver.

* Added a mechanism to make the stiffness matrix symmetric, if
  possible. The mesh status window in the solver page reports the
  symmetry status of the mesh.

* Fixed a bug in the labelled slider widgets which could cause them to
  reject typed in values.

* Eliminated the spurious warnings about uncallable objects at shut
  down time.

OOF2 2.0.b3

* Fixed boundary intersection checking, and the reset function for
  unpromoting promoted floating boundary conditions.  These were
  resulting in spurious reports of boundary condition collisions.

* Fixed a bug in the post-script output for saved images -- selections
  were being drawn incorrectly for non-square images.

* Simplified the names of the Property classes
  (Elasticity:Anisotropic:CubicElasticity is now
  Elasticity:Anisotropic:Cubic).  Added symmetries for thermal
  expansion and thermal conductivity.  Changed the display of
  Properties in the Materials window so that the full names are shown.

* The OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Conditions.New menu has been replaced with an
  OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Conditions.New command.  The old submenus
  (Dirichlet, Neumann, etc) are now arguments to the New
  command. Similar changes were made to the OOF.Mesh.Profiles.New
  menu.  This is more in line with the way other commands work.

* Simple representations of functions (eg boundary condition profiles)
  are now allowed in scripts.  Instead of
  "function=XYStrFunction('x+y')" it's now possible to use
  "function='x+y'".  Doing this requires that *all* arguments used in
  scripts are keyword arguments, so 'Gray(0.8)' is now
  "Gray(value=0.8)".

* Fixed a sensitization error in dialog boxes with function parameters.

* Two Pixel Groups cannot have the same names in a Microstructure --
  it was possible before, because we thought it would be fun! Not any
  more.

* Pixel selection and material assignment operations now all respect
  the active area, if appropriate.

* The pixel selection modifier 'Intersect Group' now works correctly.

* Upon creating simple skeleton, elements' homogeneity is automatically
  set to be 1.0.

* When finding transition points for Snap Nodes, homogeneity of the element
  is always checked beforehand -- Purely homogeneous elements will not be
  looked at.

* Added an extra margin around postscript output, so rounding
  errors in the bounding box or clipping path don't cause a loss
  of data.

* Starting oof2 in the background ("% oof2 &") works in GUI mode.

* Simplified the Mesh Cross Section toolbox and display somewhat, by
  removing the Autodisplay button and adding a '<None>' entry in the
  cross section list.

* Attempting to move Skeleton nodes when no Skeleton is displayed
  doesn't generate errors anymore.

* Boundary creation and removal operations which take place in 
  skeletons are now propagated to meshes created from that skeleton.

* Boundary modification now actually works for skeletons which 
  differ from their parents only by node moves, and these boundary
  modifications are propagated to the meshes.

* Added a "--with-lapack=-l<custom lapack>" argument to the configuration
  script.

* Moved field and flux display out of the Mesh Info toolbox and into a
  separate data viewer window.  It can display more values and is a
  better use of real estate.

* Data files saved in the "script" format load correctly.

* Skeleton groups (of nodes, segments, and elements) are stored in
  data files.

* Fixed a divide by zero error that could arise when selecting nodes
  in a Skeleton with an unfortunate choice of dimensions.

* Selecting "actual" for the the "where" parameter in Mesh displays
  works even if the displacement field isn't defined on the Mesh.

* Require that progress bar delay time be an integer number of
  milliseconds.

* Made the graphics windows (more) thread safe.

* Boundary construction is now context-sensitive, the GUI does not present
  disallowed "Directors" (i.e. you can't pick left-to-right if your 
  segments form a loop).

* Stiffness matrix reconstruction is now skipped if it's not required
  by changes in the status of the mesh.  Nonlinear materials which require
  a new stiffness matrix even when nothing else has changed must register
  themselves with "nonlinear=1" to cause the matrix to be rebuilt.

* Fixed the tutorial bug which would sometimes enable the "Next" button
  when the last entry was displayed.

* Fixed a bug in the stopping criterion for iterative skeleton modifiers.

* Fixed a bug in which using the window manager's close button
  (instead of the window's "Cancel" button) to close a file selection
  window could lead to a crash.

* Completely reworked the Analysis page in the main OOF2 window.

OOF2 2.0.b2

* Used a common scheme for all parameter names.

OOF2 2.0.b1

* "Initial" release, which was put on the web site prematurely for a
   few hours, so we called the next "initial" release b2 just in case
   someone had managed to download b1.
